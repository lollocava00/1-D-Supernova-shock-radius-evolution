# Introduction to Zeus-2D codee and relevant equations
The code I built is based upon the !["ZEUS-2D"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJS...80..753S/abstract) paper which solves the Hydrodynamics equations in 2 dimensions, I used a one dimensional version of it to reproduce the evolution of a Supernova explosion which is assumed to be spherically symmetric. The numerical approach taken is discussed in the following chapter.

## Hydro Equations

The goal of the project is, in its essence, to solve the following set of equations for a specific astrophysical problem: 

$$\frac{D\rho}{Dt}     =-\rho \nabla \cdot v $$

$$\rho \frac{Dv}{Dt}   =-\nabla p  $$

$$\frac{D\epsilon}{Dt} =-p\nabla \cdot v $$

When integrating the respective lagrangian derivatives,

$$ \frac{D}{Dt} \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + v\cdot \nabla$$

these three equations define the conservation laws for $\rho$ (density), v (velocity) and $\epsilon$ (energy) respectively. p (pressure) is determined by an equation of state, which in this case is set to be

$$p=(\gamma- 1)\epsilon$$

where $\gamma$ is set to the value $\gamma=\frac{5}{3}$.

Equations 1-3 constitute a set of hyperbolic partial differential equations, which are tackled in the code through a finite-differences approach (upwind I); in particular, the code breaks the solving procedure in two separate steps:
- Source step, where only the soure terms of the equations are considered:

$$\rho \frac{Dv}{Dt} =-\nabla p -\nabla Q $$

 $$       \frac{D\epsilon}{Dt}=-p\nabla \cdot v -Q \nabla \cdot v$$

 where Q is an \textbf{artificial viscosity term} that will be discussed later; 
    
  - Transport step, which accounts for the effects of fluid advection:

$$ \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \int_V \rho dV =-\int_{\partial V} \rho v \;dS $$
    
$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_V \rho v dV =-\int_{\partial V} \rho v^2 \; dS $$
    
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_V \epsilon dV =-\int_{\partial V} \epsilon v \;dS $$
   
    (the grid velocity is assumed to be null for our purposes).
The aforementioned equations are solved on two staggered grids,  named $x_a$ and $x_b$, where $x_b(i)=x_a(i+\frac{1}{2})$. A choice is also available between two differente coordinate systems (cartesian or spherical).

# Introduction to the Astrophysical problem
On average, a total energy of about $10^{51} erg$ is injected into the interstellar medium (ISM) by supernovae.
The resulting shock wave propagates outwards at very high speed, but quickly loses large amounts of energy due to compression and heating of the ISM and also because of radiative losses. To allow the modelling of this rather complex process, some simplifying assumptions were made, which include radial symmetry of the entire system, a uniform ISM, the absence of a stellar wind phase before the explosion and thermal conduction is neglected. 

The code is set up to allow for the analysis of an expanding SuperNova Remnant (SNR), more specifically in the following terms:
- evolution of $\rho$,$p$,$T$ and $v$ over various time ranges;
- evolution of the shock radius generated by the supernova event in radial expansion;
- evolution of the X-RAY luminosity of the source as a function of time;
- the kinetic and thermal energy fractions injected into the surrounding ISM as a function of time.

The aforementioned characteristics are evaluated both in the presence and lack of radiative cooling as to highlight possible differences. 
The initial conditions chosen for this setting are typical values in the ISM:

$$d_0&=2\cdot 10^{-24} g/cm^3 $$

$$ T_0&=10^4 K $$

$$e_0&=c_v d_0 T_0 \quad where \quad c_v=2\cdot 10^8 \, cgs $$

$$   p_0&=e_0(\gamma -1) \quad where \quad  \gamma=5/3$$

The central energy values are set to $E_0 = 10^{51} \, erg$ in order to simulate a realistic supernova output; this allows us to define the central energy density as

   $$ e(2)=e(3)=\frac{E_0}{\frac{4}{3}\pi x_a^3} $$

The time step over which the DO loop runs is set to:

 $$   \Delta t=cfl *\frac{\Delta x}{|v|+c_s}$$

where the $cfl$ value is increased from $0.01$ to $0.5$ along with the time integration, in the code:

  $$  clf=min(0.5\, , \, clf*1.1).$$

Such values for $\Delta t$ always satisfy the stability condition of Upwind I order method; 

  $$  \Delta t \leq \frac{\Delta x}{v}$$
